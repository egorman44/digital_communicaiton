    These tables are used for multiplication/division since addition/substraction are simple XOR operations inside GF of characteristic 2.
    The basic idea is quite simple: since b**(log_b(x), log_b(y)) == x * y given any number b (the base or generator of the logarithm), then we can use any number b to precompute logarithm and anti-log (exponentiation) tables to use for multiplying two numbers x and y.
    That's why when we use a different base/generator number, the log and anti-log tables are drastically different, but the resulting computations are the same given any such tables.

    '''
    # generator is the generator number (the "increment" that will be used to walk through the field by multiplication, this must be a prime number). This is basically the base of the logarithm/anti-log tables. Also often noted "alpha" in academic books.
    # prim is the primitive/prime (binary) polynomial and must be irreducible (ie, it can't represented as the product of two smaller polynomials). It's a polynomial in the binary sense: each bit is a coefficient, but in fact it's an integer between field_charac+1 and field_charac*2, and not a list of gf values. The prime polynomial will be used to reduce the overflows back into the range of the Galois Field without duplicating values (all values should be unique). See the function find_prime_polys() and: http://research.swtch.com/field and http://www.pclviewer.com/rs2/galois.html
    # note that the choice of generator or prime polynomial doesn't matter very much: any two finite fields of size p^n have identical structure, even if they give the individual elements different names (ie, the coefficients of the codeword will be different, but the final result will be the same: you can always correct as many errors/erasures with any choice for those parameters). That's why it makes sense to refer to all the finite fields, and all decoders based on Reed-Solomon, of size p^n as one concept: GF(p^n). It can however impact sensibly the speed (because some parameters will generate sparser tables).
